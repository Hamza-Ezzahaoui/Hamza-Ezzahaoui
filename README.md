🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a Computer Science engineering student with strong hands-on experience in Cybersecurity, passionate about threat detection, incident response, and SOC operations.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on 20+ cybersecurity projects and labs covering SIEM, SOAR, forensic analysis, network monitoring, and automation.
I also completed multiple internships in system administration, virtualization, and security, where I applied my technical and analytical skills in real environments.

My mission: continuously learn, defend, and automate to make digital environments safer and smarter.

🎯 Objective

To join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst or Cybersecurity Engineer, applying my hands-on expertise in detection engineering, automation, and incident response.
